Hi! here's some more info on what this is. Basically I was thinking it would be
awesome if the
noun project had an API for their icons- it would totally make them spread
faster. After I
couldn't find one I wrote a simple one using bottle.

You can get an icon of a particular noun as an img or a json.

For the json:
just search the <noun> with http://texticons.whichlight.com/api/<noun>, and
you'll get back a json with
{'status' : ' ... ', 'data' : '...'} where status will be Success if there is an
icon, and
Fail if there is not. 'data' will return back the icon link if there is an icon.
it just
retrieves the first icon if there are multiple ones.

For the img:
just search the <noun> with http://texticons.whichlight.com/icon/<noun> and
you'll get an img.
